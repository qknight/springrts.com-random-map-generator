Q) what is this all about?
A) this projects as create as a frontend for libnoise to generate maps
   for the rts spring

Q) what is special about this map generator? (when it's done)
A) it is completely procedural and therefore a whole map can be generated
   based on a few noisegen modules.
    this means: - the recipe is some xml (1-2kb)
                - the output map (outmap.sd7 is 1-30mb+)

Q) what advantages does this bring?
A) - 'very small (size::kbytes)' map definition file (xml) which can be compiled on demand
   - a map can be remixed easiliy: just open the xml file in the editor,
     make minor changes which affect the produced map by a big amount.
     (ever thought: mars.sd7 is a great concept but he,
     please change the terrain a little bit next game?)
   - one can see the source of a map, this helps to improve a map over time as:
     - rebalancing of resources
     - fixes in textures can be applied easily afterwars
   - shorter download times. less waste of bandwidth!

Q) are there any screenshots of the editor or maps?
A) see http://lastlog.de/misc/spring/
