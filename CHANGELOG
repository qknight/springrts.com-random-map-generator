 - summary: inserting connections works no backend wise
   - Model.h/cpp insertConnection(..) rewritten
   - DataAbstractModule ...
   - DataConnection.cpp/.h needs rewriting
 - Port(s) are now created according to the module settings
 - added int ports(int type) to DataAbstractModule, with this function the view 
   (read class Module : public QGraphicsItem) can query via the model how many Port(s)
   are needed per type.

 - QGraphicsItem(s) query the model with modelData(..)/setModelData(..) and they use
   GraphicsItemModelExtension for that which is also an abstract base class to force
   the final item to implement type() and some other functions which are very important
   for the QGraphicsScene <-> QAbstractItemModel overlay to be there.

2010-01-23
 - QGraphicsItem(s) in automate have the 'model extension' given by a multiple inheritence 'inheriting class'
   using GraphicsItemModelExtension now makes data(..)/setData(..) very easy! ;)

 - graphicsview must position right over 0/0 above the scene
 - adding an item SHOULD NOT move the VIEW (GraphicsView)
   POSSIBLE FIX: doc->scene->setSceneRect(QRect(-width/2,-height/2,width,height));
    but using this results in no scrollbars and the scene does not exapand at all....
   FINAL FIX
      void GraphicsView::resizeEvent(QResizeEvent* event) {
        QRectF v = sceneRect();
        setSceneRect(v.x(),v.y(),v.width(),v.height());
      } 
 - moving an item SHOULD NOT expand the VIEW
   POSSIBLE FIX: rewrite the resize() and keep it at width()/height() instead of the
                 real scene's sceneRect() which can be greater
   FINAL FIX
      see void GraphicsView::resizeEvent(QResizeEvent* event) {

 - the scrollbars should indicated NOT how big the document is BUT instead
   they should scroll the view in the range most left item <-> most right item
   and top vs bottom items equivalent
   FIX no scrollbars for the moment

 - moving an item MUST NOT scroll the scene if the item is towards a border
  FIX: reimplement mouseMoveEvent as the documentation about ScrollHandDrag or 
       similar referes to, see libnoise-viewer where i have done that already
  FIX: the QGraphisView (or GraphicsView) must have a fixed width/height and MUST NOT resize!
2010-01-22
 - view can now be moved but items can't be selected anymore ;P
2010-01-21
 - adding modules using the QMenu context menu on the scene now is partially fixed,
   still the QCursor position is used instead of the QMenu position
 - modules are now inserted into the QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView and can be moved
 - class Model is nearly done, only minor additions (NO CHANGES ;-) need to be done
 - QGraphicsItem(s) don't update them selfs and they don't query the model yet

2010-01-10
 - GraphicsScene can now insert modules via rightclick

2009-12-18
 - CHANGELOG created
