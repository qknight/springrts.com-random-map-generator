 - added some code to finally insert connections, all that is missing is:
  - implementation of Model::insertConnection(...)
  - formal checks for correctness of the to be inserted connection
  - fix Connection class, which does the drawing of the connection
  - probably changes in the backend: DataConnection

2010-05-03
 - added a new hierarchy layer to the Model:
   rootNode - module - port - connection 
     istead of
   rootNode - module - connection 
   
   - Q: could it be easier to have an abstraction like this:
   I) root-module-port-connection compared to VS
  II) root-module-connection (with transparent ports?)
  A: an output port can have multiple output lines
     an input port can only have one ingoing connection

     + it might be easier to implement it the I) way since one does not need the complicated transpartent
       port checks
     + if ports would be QModelIndex'es it would be easy to find the parent
       which is good since the parent "could" need to validate the connection request
       (currently this is done by the connection, which is bad)
     CURRENT STATUS OF MIGRATION:
      - modules appear and input ports are there
      - modputs/outputs are not done yet
      - the concept, mentioned above, now works. however it's not complete since there is a issue:
        I) while adding a module, transparently also add ports VS
       II) after adding a module, the Module registers at the scene(), when that happens the ports
           are added.
        CURRENTLY I is implemented
          this solution looks much much better since:
            - less code
            - less complex code
            - (less object interaction)
    FIXED

2010-02-02
 - connections are now inserted at the module with the output side, using the GraphicsScene
   one can add modules and it does not matter if one selects a free output port and connects
   it to a free input port or vice versa.
 - problem: modules could be asked if they like the connection but it is not implemented
   but can be done, see Model.cpp insertConnection(...) where i have included
   some concept code
2010-01-26
 - create functionality to 'add connections' by click'n'drag'n'drop is done
 - modules can now be moved again but using the red line for connections works as well
2010-01-25
 - summary: inserting connections works no backend wise
   - Model.h/cpp insertConnection(..) rewritten
   - DataAbstractModule ...
   - DataConnection.cpp/.h needs rewriting
 - Port(s) are now created according to the module settings
 - added int ports(int type) to DataAbstractModule, with this function the view 
   (read class Module : public QGraphicsItem) can query via the model how many Port(s)
   are needed per type.

2010-01-24
 - QGraphicsItem(s) query the model with modelData(..)/setModelData(..) and they use
   GraphicsItemModelExtension for that which is also an abstract base class to force
   the final item to implement type() and some other functions which are very important
   for the QGraphicsScene <-> QAbstractItemModel overlay to be there.

2010-01-23
 - QGraphicsItem(s) in automate have the 'model extension' given by a multiple inheritence 'inheriting class'
   using GraphicsItemModelExtension now makes data(..)/setData(..) very easy! ;)

 - graphicsview must position right over 0/0 above the scene
 - adding an item SHOULD NOT move the VIEW (GraphicsView)
   POSSIBLE FIX: doc->scene->setSceneRect(QRect(-width/2,-height/2,width,height));
    but using this results in no scrollbars and the scene does not exapand at all....
   FINAL FIX
      void GraphicsView::resizeEvent(QResizeEvent* event) {
        QRectF v = sceneRect();
        setSceneRect(v.x(),v.y(),v.width(),v.height());
      } 
 - moving an item SHOULD NOT expand the VIEW
   POSSIBLE FIX: rewrite the resize() and keep it at width()/height() instead of the
                 real scene's sceneRect() which can be greater
   FINAL FIX
      see void GraphicsView::resizeEvent(QResizeEvent* event) {

 - the scrollbars should indicated NOT how big the document is BUT instead
   they should scroll the view in the range most left item <-> most right item
   and top vs bottom items equivalent
   FIX no scrollbars for the moment

 - moving an item MUST NOT scroll the scene if the item is towards a border
  FIX: reimplement mouseMoveEvent as the documentation about ScrollHandDrag or 
       similar referes to, see libnoise-viewer where i have done that already
  FIX: the QGraphisView (or GraphicsView) must have a fixed width/height and MUST NOT resize!
2010-01-22
 - view can now be moved but items can't be selected anymore ;P
2010-01-21
 - adding modules using the QMenu context menu on the scene now is partially fixed,
   still the QCursor position is used instead of the QMenu position
 - modules are now inserted into the QGraphicsScene/QGraphicsView and can be moved
 - class Model is nearly done, only minor additions (NO CHANGES ;-) need to be done
 - QGraphicsItem(s) don't update them selfs and they don't query the model yet

2010-01-10
 - GraphicsScene can now insert modules via rightclick

2009-12-18
 - CHANGELOG created
